-1. History
-----------
As you can understand it, by the project name, this is one other implementation of a TV program grabber!
This script is intented to be integrated to Mythtv (http://www.mythtv.org/) to feed the backend shueduler.

The generated output, after grabbing the tv programs, has to embrace the xmltv DTD (http://wiki.xmltv.org)
This project was born to grab the http://cablecom.tvtv.ch (German Version) website, but some adaptation should
extend its action to other sites!

0. Prerequisite
---------------
The grabber is written in "perl" and the following modules have to be installed:
* strict
* Getopt::Long
* LWP::UserAgent
* File::Path

The script also uses some external program:
* wget

Notes:
the script was initially implemented with Perl v5.10.0 and wget v1.11.4

1. Launch the script
--------------------
When you are sure all the required Perl and Wget are installed, you can try:
$> chmod 700 ./grabtv.pl
$> ./grabtv.pl --help
or 
$> perl ./grabtv.pl -h

2. Options
----------

-d|--days nbrOfDaysToGrab
