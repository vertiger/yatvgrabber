= History =

The YATVG project idea was submited by Lars, for his personal use ... The TV grabber should be compatible with the [http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page XMLTV format].

It has to grab the maximum of information, like actors, directors, description, audio format, tv format, ...

As the existing tv grabber were also written in perl language, this project moves in the same direction! (Because perl offers a good support of regular expressions)

One usage of this script would be to integrate it with [http://www.mythtv.org/ MYTHTV] for automatically record you favorite shows...

In the other hand you can also convert the xmltv file to latex using [http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man1/tv_to_latex.html tv_to_latex]...
